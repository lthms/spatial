# Waybar Theme

This folder contains a theme which can be used with Waybar. It assumes the
`spatialbar` script is available from `$PATH`, for instance by moving it to
`.local/bin`.

To build and install `spatialbar`, you can use the Makefile at the root of the
repository.

```bash
make install-contrib
```
