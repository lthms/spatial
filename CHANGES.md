## Release 1 (2023-04-29)

The first release of Spatial Shell establishes a strong foundation for the
project. Following in i3 and swayâ€™s footsteps, it introduces a daemon
(`spatial`), a client (`spatialmsg`), and a IPC protocol for them to
communicate.

The spatial model implemented by `spatial` allows users to navigate a grid of
windows wherein workspaces are rows, and to alternate between two layouts
(Maximize, and Column).

This is described in depth in the man pages introduced in this release.
